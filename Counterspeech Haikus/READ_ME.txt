This directory contains filed related to my final project for Big Data Management and Analytics:

Generating Counterspeech Haikus to Hatespeech

The goal of this project is to produce counterspeech (in the form of traditional 5, 7, 5 syllable format haikus) to hatespeech.

I utilized OpenAI's API to fine-tune their models to unseen data and generated haikus through a pipeline.

The presentation contains a visual flow of the pipeline.

The report dives in a little deeper to explain the pipeline and methodologies.
